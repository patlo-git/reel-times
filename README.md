# ReelTimes

## With ReelTimes, moviegoers can now easily see all local movie listings at a glance.

### ReelTimes’ minimalist layout, using the person’s location, displays a list of local theater and film showtimes on one page. In addition to the standard information, such as movie rating, length, and genre, users will get a glimpse of critic and audience reviews, have the option to view trailers, and see screening amenities info without leaving the listings page.

### See you at the movies!

## Getting Started

Fork the repo. From the terminal, install packages with `npm i` and run the app with `npm run dev`.

**Note:** Currently, showtime results are only from the 93109 zip code and, to get around rate limiting, we are rendering our cached response data from the Gracenote API.
